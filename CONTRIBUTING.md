# Suggesting improvements

You are welcome to suggest any improvements to the extension. If you have any ideas, please open an issue.

If you wish to develop the feature yourself, the better. Otherwise, it might be picked up by someone else.

# Before developing

I suggest opening a new issue and discussing it before you start working on a pull request.

If there is an existing issue that you wish to contribute to, make sure it's been greenlit.

# Developing

## Required dependencies

* Node.js and NPM
* Firefox Developer Edition (for local testing)
    * The regular edition of Firefox does not
      support unsigned web
      extensions - and, in the general case, that's what you'll have during development.

## Building

Simply run `npm run build` in the project directory.

## See your changes in Firefox

To do so, run and then `npm run start`. Build it beforehand if you want to see your changes.
