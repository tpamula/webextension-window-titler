# Window Titler

![icon](icons/dark/icon-128.png)

A Firefox extension that lets you add a custom per-window title. Useful if you like to have topically themed Firefox windows.

## Usage
Window Titler adds prefix to the browser's system window title bar. Please note the title bar is disabled by default in Firefox but can easily be enabled. The added prefix can be seen in the system's task switcher as well.

You can invoke Window Titler simply by pressing its toolbar button or by using the shortcut: **Ctrl-Alt-T**.
